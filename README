# Bitcoin-Blockchain-Parser-using-ECL

## Steps to Run

1. Upload and spray the file ```data/blk00000.dat``` file onto the cluster in blob format. Note that the logical name should also be ```blk00000.dat``` as the parser expects blk files in sequential order. 
2. This would spray the file in a location similar to ```/var/lib/HPCCSystems/hpcc-data/thor``` folder.
3. ```parser.ecl``` is the file containing the complete parser and doesn't depend on any external libraries.
4. Replace the variable ```dataPath``` in ```parser.ecl``` with the path to the *folder* containing the above sprayed ```blk00000.dat``` file.
5. Finally replace the path to the output.csv file in parser.ecl (Line 9820) as required. Having path to the dropzone is essential to be able to download and view the csv file upon running the parser.
6. Run the parser.ecl as a workunit by replacing the above paths if needed.
7. Refresh the dropzone page on ecl watch to be able to view and download the output.csv file.
